# What is wrong with the following code:

# Traceback (most recent call last):

# Create a dictionary with the country followed by it's capital city
# for the following countries:
# China, Germany, Greece, Russia, United Kingdom

# Print out only the values

# >>> ord('A')

# What do you think ord does?  Can you apply it to a list in a loop?

# Can you apply it using a map?
# >>> list(map(ord, 'Hello'))

# What if ou had a word and you wanted to convert it to a stream of bits
# How can you do this using ordinal and map?
