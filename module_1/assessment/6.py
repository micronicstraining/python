# Create a variable called digits and make it 
# have the numbers 0 to 9 populated



# Is the following true?
digits == list(range(10))



# the range operator also includes a lower bound 
# How can you create a range from 5 to 10 including 10?




# How can you create a range from 1000 to (including) 10000 
# by increments of 10?



# Given the previous list what is 2nd element to the last?
# What is the 101th element to the last?



# Use a for loop to add the numbers 5 to 50


# use a map


# There is a formula to get the sum of numbers from 0 to N:
# its n*(n-1)/2.  So for 10 it would be (9)*(10)/2 = 45
# Complete the function which computes this:
def sum_ordered(n):
   pass

# there is a built in function called sum
# use to with the range function to make the following
# right hand portion true
sum_ordered(15) == ?


# How can you use sum_ordered to get the sum of the numbers 5 to 50?
# That is without modifying it?
