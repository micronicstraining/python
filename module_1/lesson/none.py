# Lets explore the simplest data-type in Python

# Sometimes in programming you want to use a certain variable
# which doesn't have any data in it yet (or may never have any data).
# This is where None comes in.


# if you type into your python3 REPL
# >>> print(my_undefined_variable)
# What will happen?


# Since it is not defined to have a value the variable is not bound
# and is therefore not a variable.

# You get a not defined NameError exception

# In order to make it a variable, without giving it a 'real' value
# use None
# >>> my_undefined_variable = None
# now print it out.  What do you get?

# PRACTICE
# Try the following experiment
# Type 5 into the shell
# What do you get back out?
# Type 'hello' into the shell
# What do you get back out?
# Type None into the shell?
# What do you get back out?


# Its interesting to note that if you do:
# print('hello') you get a result
# and just tying in 'hello' gives you a result,
# There is also a way to print out None, however,
# The REPL doesn't have an underlying value so just typing in
# None gives you... nothing


# What is the type of None?
# What is the type of it's type?



# Do you think all of the built in types, have a base type of type?
